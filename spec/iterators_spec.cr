# An Iterator allows processing sequences lazily,
# as opposed to Enumerable which processes sequences eagerly
# and produces an Array in most of its methods.

# To implement an Iterator you need to define a #next method that must return the next element in the sequence or Iterator::Stop::INSTANCE, which signals the end of the sequence (you can invoke #stop inside an iterator as a shortcut).
