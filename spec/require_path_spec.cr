# in many files and how you can manage them.

# require accepts a single argument: a string literal, and it can come in many flavors.
# Once a file is required, the compiler remembers its absolute path and later requires of that same file will be ignored.

# while doing these exercise, please open the lib folder and have a look where the constants are defined.
